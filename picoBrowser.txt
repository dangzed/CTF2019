Thats your user-agent. You can see it by typing navigator.userAgent in console. So to capture
this flag, you need to change the userAgent to googlebot. Select the tab Network conditions
( next to console tab ), uncheck the Select automatically box -> set to custom ->set the value
to picobrowser.
Now press the Flag button, we have the flag:
	picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_3e1c0ea2}
