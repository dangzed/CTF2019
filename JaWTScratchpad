   Type random input, we can log in with a cookie named jwt, which is actually a json 
web token, generated by jwt.io website. I really cant go further because I have no idea how to get the secret key, so I have to
look it up on the Internet. A team named 4rth4s's founded it with jwt_tool tool and rockyou.txt wordlist. After 7 mins 
using brute force, they found the secret key is 'ilovepico' ( tbh I didn't think a game with 400 pts is that hard, I gave up 
pretty soon 'cause I thought the secret key is hidden somewhere :))  ) So now with the secret key, we generate admin jwt by 
changing the payload to "user":"admin". The flag is there:

picoCTF{jawt_was_just_what_you_thought_be9ef99e529597da0f3543893357908b}
