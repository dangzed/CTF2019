We try to do something just like 2 similar problems before (sql injection), but the
word 'or' become 'be' now. So I decided to try other random character, I typed in 
	abcdefghi
In the debug mode it becomes 'nopqrstu'. Now we know the password field will be encoded,
we simply type 'be' instead of 'or' like this:
	'be'1=1
And the flag'll show up
