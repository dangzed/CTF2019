When we login with a random username and password, we received 'login failed' notification
In the request header, we see that besides 2 fields username and password, there is a third
field debug=0. 
	That doesn't make sense. Go back to the html and we found a hidden element: debug
and default value is 0. Change the value to 1 and login again, we see the SQL command :
	select * from users where name ='asd' and password ='asdsa'
Now its simple right ? We do a basic sql injection by filling in password field like this:
	abc' OR '1=1
